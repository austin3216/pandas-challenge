## Observations

1. Overall, students perform better in reading than math.
2. Scores by School Spending indicate that higher school budgets/higher budgets per student will not necessarily result in better performance outcomes (higher scores).
3. There is a stark difference in % Overall Passing between Small/Medium size and Large size schools; an assumption could be made that large population schools see poorer performance outcomes, but this is absent other critical factors such as teacher census and classroom size.
4. Charter Schools have better performance outcomes in all areas than District Schools; next steps with this dataset for me would be to see Spending Per Student alongside School Type, and School Size alongside School Type, to create a more contextual observation.
